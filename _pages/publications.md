### [Systema: a framework for evaluating genetic perturbation response prediction beyond systematic variation]([https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.20.665723v1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02777-8))
Predicting transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations is challenging in functional genomics. While recent methods aim to infer effects of untested perturbations, their true predictive power remains unclear. Here, we show that current methods struggle to generalize beyond systematic variation, the consistent transcriptional differences between perturbed and control cells arising from selection biases or confounders. [...]

### [A contextualised protein language model reveals the functional syntax of bacterial evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.20.665723v1)
Bacteria have evolved a vast diversity of functions and behaviours which are currently incompletely understood and poorly predicted from DNA sequence alone. To understand the syntax of bacterial evolution and discover genome-to-phenotype relationships, we curated over 1.3 million genomes spanning bacterial phylogenetic space, representing each as an ordered sequence of proteins which collectively were used to train a transformer-based, contextualised protein language model, Bacformer. [...]

### [Sequence-based modelling of bacterial genomes enables accurate antibiotic resistance prediction](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.03.574022v1)
Rapid detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and understanding the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are major unsolved problems that pose significant threats to global public health. [...]

### [On Masked Language Models for Contextual Link Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2022.deelio-1.9.pdf)
In the real world, many relational facts require context; for instance, a politician holds a given elected position only for a particular timespan. [...]

### [Stabilizing generative adversarial networks: A survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00927.pdf)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative model which have received much attention due to their ability to model complex real-world data. Despite their
recent successes, the process of training GANs remains challenging [...]
