### [Sequence-based modelling of bacterial genomes enables accurate antibiotic resistance prediction](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.03.574022v1)
Rapid detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and understanding the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are major unsolved problems that pose significant threats to global public health. [...]

### [Stabilizing generative adversarial networks: A survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00927.pdf)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative model which have received much attention due to their ability to model complex real-world data. Despite their
recent successes, the process of training GANs remains challenging [...]
