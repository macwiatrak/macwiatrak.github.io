* I am a PhD student at Cambridge Center for AI in Medicine (CCAIM), University of Cambridge, where I am supervised by Prof. Andres Floto, Dr Sarah Teichmann and Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar.
* My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of machine learning anb biology. I leverage ML methods to better understand causes of diseases using and integrating various data sources and modalities.
* Previously I spent almost three years working at BenevolentAI, a pharma company leveraging AI for drug discovery, where I still work on some cutting edge part-time projects. While at BenevolentAI I had the opportunity to work on various ML projects with an amazing and diverse group of people, including biologists, chemists, software engineers and AI Scientists.
[//]: # (* enjoyed working at Autonomous Agents Research Group at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Dr Stefano Albrecht]&#40;http://svalbrecht.de/&#41; where I was researching stabilizing Generative Adversarial Networks training and 2 amazing start-ups; Growbots &#40;advised by OpenAI's co-founder&#41; and Plural AI &#40;backed  by Entrepreneur First&#41; where I did some NLP & engineering work.)
* I received my Bachelor's degree from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) where I have graduated with a first class honours BASc degree with distinction (Dean's List), majoring in computer science. My dissertation focused on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in sequential social dilemmas and was advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/) and Dr [Manuela Dal Borgo](https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-manuela-dal-borgo).
